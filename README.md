<img src="https://i.ibb.co/bHMyx8Z/pcc1.png" alt="Preview"/>

# Description:
A platform, which will allow you to get an appointment with a doctor online, that is, through chat or video chat communication. From now on, patients no longer need to spend time in line while waiting for a doctor's appointment. This platform is implemented in such a way that a person does not have to leave their home, but rather devote more time to treatment. Moreover, on this platform it will also be possible to pay for the appointment with the receipt of an electronic check. Thanks to this platform, the patient will be able to stay at home without endangering himself and others. This is especially true during the period of seasonal colds, when there is a surge in diseases.
